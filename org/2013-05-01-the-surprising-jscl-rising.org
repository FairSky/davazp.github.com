#+TITLE: The surprising JSCL rising
#+KEYWORDS: lisp

I am just back of a few days of holidays and have seen how active JSCL
is!  It is really exciting.

This rising is due to [[https://github.com/abeaumont][abeaumont]] probably. I stopped working, but he
came up with an idea I liked. It is, why don't integrate JSCL into
[[http://conkeror.org/][Conkeror]]? We would end up with a Lisp programmable browser... that's a
practical reason!  We did some tests locally and it seemed to work,
but now it is time for improving JSCL itself.

It is not the only platform where JSCL could run on. I plan to add
support for [[http://nodejs.org/][Node JS]]. Indeed, it will let us use the REPL and tests in
the terminal in addition to the browser, which is a much more
convenient way to program.

In the meantime, I would like to improve the compiler a little bit.

Suggestion and patches are very welcome if you want to join us.
