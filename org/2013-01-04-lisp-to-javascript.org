#+TITLE: Lisp to Javascript compiler

[[http://puntoblogspot.blogspot.ie/][Raimon Grau]] and I have been working on a simple Lisp to Javascript
compiler, in order to better understand how to bootstrap it. Now we
got it. It compiles itself and the resulting code can be used from the
browser. It can even call its own internals, which is quite nice.

It is not very helpful, you can [[http://davazp.github.com/ecmalisp/ecmalisp.html][try it]]. Now I have to think if it
could be useful for something... maybe a live Lisp tutorial, or make
it suitable for Android. Any suggestions?
