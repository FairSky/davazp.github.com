#+TITLE: Special arguments
#+keywords: lisp

I have learnt a new trick these days. Did you know that you can
declare an argument as a special variable? Quoting [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_daa.htm][Hyperspec]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Each required parameter is specified by a parameter variable var. var
is bound as a lexical variable /unless it is declared special/.
#+END_QUOTE

It seems to work also for optional and keyword arguments, but
Hyperspec does not mention it explicitly. For example, yo can do:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defvar *variable*)
  (defun foo () *variable*)
  (defun foobar (&optional *variable*)
    (foo))
#+END_SRC
